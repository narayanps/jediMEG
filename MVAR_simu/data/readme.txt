G_Full_sim.mat contains LF matrix with both magnetometers and gradiometers.
simu_data.mat contains LF corresponding to only 102 magnetometers, i.e. G(1:3:306,:) which is used for simulation.
Same for estim_data.mat that is used for estimation, which contains only magnetometers from G_Full_estim.mat.
